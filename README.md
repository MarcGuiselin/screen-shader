## Why tint my screen?

Computer displays produce bright blue light which can strain your eyes late at night and interfere with your sleeping cycle.
Screen Shader is designed to tint your screen a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù orange color matching to your biological clock to reduce eye-strain, eye fatigue, and restore day/night balance, while also providing a wide variety of settings for everyone's different tastes!

__üåõ Feeling tired?__ Screen Shader will ease you into sleep automatically. The increased shade will increase melatonin hormone production right before sleep. Set what time you wake up and your geographical position and Screen Shader will do the rest!

__üíª Ready to work?__ Screen Shader keeps you awake during the daytime. As long as the sun is up where you live your screen stays bright! During the night it will turn down the brightness since the sun isn't up anymore.

So do your eyes a favor, [install __Screen Shader__](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-shader-smart-scree/fmlboobidmkelggdainpknloccojpppi)!
