            <h2>Not working on the new tab page?</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately chrome extension permissions prevent Screen Shader from shading the new tab, &#x1F622; however, installing the
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogggehcanmknkicaiilbajdafalhlejm">Screen Shader Dark Theme</a>
                or any other 
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/collection/dark_themes">dark theme</a>
                from the chrome web store will change the new tab to a color that isn't bright white! &#x1F60E;
            </p>
            <h2>White flash?</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes when switching tabs chrome might flash bright white as it loads the page. &#x1F615;
                Screen Shader tries to shade the page as soon as possible, but often the browser is too slow and the result is that the screen flashes white between changing tabs.
                This can be fixed by installing the
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogggehcanmknkicaiilbajdafalhlejm">Screen Shader Dark Theme</a>
                which changes that white color to black. &#x26F1;
            </p>
            <h2>Not working in incognito?</h2>
            <p>
                Chrome extensions are disabled by default in incognito mode. If you'd like Screen Shader or any other extension to work you can go to the
                <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> page, click on Screen Shader and check "Allow in incognito."
            </p>
            <h2>Screen Shader slowing down chrome or pixelating part of the page?</h2>
            <p>
                Click on the Screen Shader icon, navigate to the "Settings" page and change "Color Blending Algorithm" to "Opacity".
                This shading algorithm is the fastest to compute and will use less processing power than the others at the expense of looking worse. &#x23F3;
            </p>
            <h2>Can't scroll?</h2>
            <p>
                The scrolling issue on pdfs and other imbedded items was a bug in chrome that was fixed. Update chrome to version 72 or above.
